Country Code Finder Web Service interview Challange

Please write a web application and send it back as zip file:
which waits for a user action, e.g. clicking buttons. According to these actions some data (see further below) should be:
shown nicely formatted on the screen
downloaded as CSV file
You can either download the data on each request during the runtime of your program or load the data from a database (in this case do NOT provide a DB dump, but a script which automatically transfers the data from the remote location to the DB)
preferably the implementation should be written in "clean code", separate concerns using pattern like MVC, be object oriented, very good testable, best even already contain Unit tests and maybe even follow the KISS and SOLID principles
 
the data should be a list of countries with their country code
Please download the base data from http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=943PQQ0n
